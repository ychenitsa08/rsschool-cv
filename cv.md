## About me
I have started learning coding about 2 years ago as a hobby while navigating my 9-5 job.
I'm interested in Web development as I think this profession allows you to be creative, flexible, and stay smart as I love how much learning to code challenges my brains!\
In my free time I enjoy stretching and yoga, simple things as coffee in the morning, walking in the park, taking videos, social media, and languages!
I want to prove to myself that even at this age (I'm 38), I can learn something new and may be with some luck be able to change careers!
